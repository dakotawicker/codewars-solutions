# Codewars Solutions 🧠⚙️

This repository contains my daily Codewars problem solutions, organized by difficulty level (8kyu being easiest, 1kyu hardest). It’s part of my commitment to practicing Python fundamentals and improving problem-solving skills for technical interviews.

## 📂 Structure
- `8kyu/`: Beginner-level problems
- `7kyu/`: Easy-to-intermediate problems
- `6kyu/`: Intermediate problems
- Each folder contains `.py` files named after the challenge, plus a `README.md` for short descriptions.

## 💡 Why This Repo?
To track coding consistency, document progress, and showcase hands-on Python problem-solving.
